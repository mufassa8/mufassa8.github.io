Error like 'fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories' occured, after processing push command from not updated local git repository.

I assume that reason of this error is kind of historical issue.

#### To solve

- git push error
    - Try ```git pull``` first
    - if it shows 'refusing to merge unrelated histories', try below
        ```
        git pull origin ${branch_name} --allow-unrelated-histories
        ```
