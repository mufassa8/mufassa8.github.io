Before deeping into DTO & DAO, Entity should comes first.

### Entity?
Entity is an Object which has _column_ as field in Database. Entity is one-to-one correspondence to table in DB.

- Should be followed
    - An entity should not have fields that doesn't match columns in corresponding table.
    - An entity class should not be inherited from other classes nor be implemented from interfaces.

- With JPA
    - Use with Annotation ```@Entity```, ```@Column```, ```@Id```
    - Getter
        ```
        @Getter
        @Entity
        @NoArgsConstructor
        public class Member member {
            ~~
        }
        ```
    - Setter than **Builder**
        ```
        @Builder
        public Member(long id, String name, String email, String phoneNumber) {
            this.id = id;
            this.name = name;
            this.email = email;
            this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
        
        ```
### DAO? (Data Access Object)
DAO is an object which really accesses to DB.
DAO plays a role as a connection between service models of project and actual Database.

#### DAO & Repository
Repository can replace DAO but both of them directly send queries to do CRUD.

DAO and Repository are not same pattern.
DAO was made by a concept of replacing Entity Bean, persistent logic.
DAO interface provides specific unit of operations corresponding to CRUD queries on Database.

On the other hand, Repository provides interface to process object collection integrally loaded on memory.

Operations on DAO is more specific than those on Repository, and, consequently, each operation on Repository are mapped into DAO's several operations. Therefore, Repository can be implemented by calling multiple DAO inside one Repository.


### DTO? (Data Transfer Object)
![DTO](https://media.vlpt.us/images/ohzzi/post/4cec2790-be9f-4263-96ee-704325bbeac1/spring-package-flow.png)

DTO plays a role as exchanger between layes. It can be seem such a kind of Wrapper made of Entity. Rather than directly deliver Entity to layer encoutering client layer such as Controller, exchange data using DTO.

As DTO is just an object which makes cross-layer exchangeble, it should be a pure data object without any special logic. Moreover, DTO has nothing to do with manipulating the data from DB so that Setter is not needed but Constuctor allocates the data. (-> similar condition of )
